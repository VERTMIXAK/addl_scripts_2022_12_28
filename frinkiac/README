What you get from frinkiac is a set of files, each with Nt values for ocean_time.
The problem is that ocean_time is in seconds instead of days, which is inconvenient for me.

Step 1.

bash fixTimes.bash

This script uses settime.py to change the numerical value of ocean_time everywhere then
uses settime.py to change the numerical value of ocean_time everywhere.

NOTE: the order seems to matter



Step 2.

Split out the frinkiac files into individual snapshots, which is what I need to calculate the IC and BC.

bash split.bash
