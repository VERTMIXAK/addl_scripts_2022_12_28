Go to

and log in

Put the desired data base into the search bar, and hit search

click on Subset / Get Data

edit time range, lat/lon range, download all variable, pick netcdf, select all times of day, then download

This will put a text file into the Downloads folder that you copy into this directory.

NOTE: the first line of this file needs to be deleted.



Use this text file as input to the getData.bash script




This creates a bunch of netcdf files, one per day. Move them into a scheduleForDeletion directory and ncrcat them
together.

Run the extractFields.bash script to create single files for each desired script. The extract script also modifies 
variable names and units, and it fixes the time stamp by running settime.py. 

Apparently, I want daily averages for albedo. This is why the extract script calls the albedo file
	MERRA_albedo_2019.nc_ORIG

Run the aveAlbedo.m script to create a smaller albedo file for the daily average. There's a lot of times, so 
this takes a while.






I don't know if this is strictly necessary, but all the MERRA files that come from Kate have Alaska in the middle. 
i.e. longitude originally runs from -180 to 180 but change this so that the longitude runs from 0 to 360. Do this with
the fixLongitude.m script then move the resulting netcdf file up one directory.
